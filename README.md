<!-- ## Alebmic Version Control

This project uses Alembic for managing database migrations and version control. Whenever there are updates to the database models, we must create and apply a migration to ensure that the database schema remains in sync with the applicationâ€™s data structures.

1. Create migration

```zsh
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migration message"
```

2. Migrate

```zsh
alembic upgrade head
```

## Seeding Database

To seed the database with:
- 3 categories (data manipulations, combinatorics, optimizations)
- subcategories for each category

- Make sure MySQL database server is up and migrated with the latest migration

- Seed database

```zsh
python -m app.seed
```
